//
//  Aggregate throughput limiter shared by all of a job's connections, so the configured cap
//  throttles *total* download speed. Instead of a mutable token count (which mis-accounts when
//  several connections await concurrently — each waking writer erased the others' debt), each
//  request atomically reserves a contiguous slot on a shared timeline cursor and sleeps until its
//  slot begins. Reserving before sleeping makes concurrent `take(_:)` calls queue correctly.
